# Q4Ex2
This repository is my attempt to Solve Q4 in Ex2 Programming exercise. Let MY24SHA and MY60SHA be hash functions which output the first 24 bits (6 nibbles) and the first 60 bits (15 nibbles) of SHA-1. For example, SHA-1 of “mark” is f1b5a91d4d6ad523f2610114591c007e75d15084 so MY24SHA and MY60SHA of “mark” are f1b5a9 and f1b5a91d4d6ad52 respectively. (a) Find any collision for MY24SHA. Note: you should find two strings such that the unix command echo -n str | sha1sum - | cut -c1-6 produces the same answer when str is replaced by each string. To enable me to verify your answer, please make sure the two strings are typable on a regular keyboard! (b) Find any collision for MY60SHA. Hint: You should not write the code for SHA-1; you should use an existing library. Part (a) is much easier to program than part (b), because in (a) you can store as many intermediate hashes as you want in memory; whereas in (b), that approach will quickly run out of memory. For part (b), it might be helpful to consider programming a cycle detection algorithm (sometimes called tortoise-and-hare algorithm).
